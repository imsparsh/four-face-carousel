four-face-carousel
==================

This is a four face carousel using javascript and jquery, that rotates by each face, with utils.js plugin

It works in every browser that supports JavaScript and CSS3, but may have issues with older versions of the browser which does not support CSS3 properties like 'perspective' {to create a 3D space} , and transformations {for rotating, scaling or skewing an element}.. 

Basic Javascript/JQuery knowledge is necesary to use this plugin: how to set parameters, callbacks, etc.
